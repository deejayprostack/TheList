Hello! This project is being developed to solve some family disputes when the subject of "Where should we go eat?" gets brought up.
Normally, we take about an hour to sort out where to go, this program aims to fix that by removing people's choice and letting the program decide.
However, it has been complicated a bit through the different tastes of my family members, meaning I have some parameters to check what day it is and if my sister is going along (very picky).
If you wish to use this program yourself, Replace the CSV file with your own and add it to the Makefile (adding it as a command line argument).
